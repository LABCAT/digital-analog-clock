### Rotating Digital Clock

In part 2 of the assignment I created a static sketch of Maeda's 8th clock without making any significant changes.  For this part of the assignment I have implemented the functionality required to make the sketch dynamic and display the current time.  

I have also decided to make animated effects of my clock different from that of Maeda's clock.  I want to combine elements of a analog clock with the digital clock so have decided to add rotating functionality. The time will be displayed digitally and will rotate in the same manner as the second hand of an analog clock.
