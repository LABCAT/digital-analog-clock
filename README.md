### Digital Water Clock

The digital water clock is inspired by real world water clocks which display time by using a varying water level. The digital water clock will represent time in the same manner using pixels rather than water.  

Different shapes will be used to represent hours, minutes and seconds. To begin with the shapes will have no background colour and as time passes the colour will change to enabling the viewer to read the current time.  The hour and minute shapes will also contain numbers that are revealed once the background becomes coloured.
