### RED ALERT

Once the alarm has less than 21 seconds until it will go off,  a visual warning is created for the viewer. This begins as a tiny red circle in the center of the canvas which gradually grows to fill the canvas before the alarm starts going off. 

The actual alarm is inspired by a play on words. When the alarm goes off the word "alert" is displayed in the center of the canvas with a flashing red background. The colour of the background combined with the word "alert" creates a rebus of the term "red alert".
